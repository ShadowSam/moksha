Authentication and Authorization in TurboGears 2
================================================

:Status: Official

This documents describes how to implement authentication and authorization in
TG 2 applications. Although there are other ways to implement it (e.g., using
the `AuthKit <http://authkit.org/>`_ package or a project-specific solution),
this document only describes the officially supported and recommended way.

Overview
--------

``Authentication`` is the act verifying that somebody is really who she claims
to be, which is normally done using credentials (e.g., when you need to access
your email, you provide the email address and your password, or if you want
to check your bank account, you'll probably have to provide you Id number and
your card's ping). In other words, finding `who` you are.

``Authorization``, on the other hand, is the act of granting access to given
resources depending on who would use them. For example, allowing registered
members to leave comments on a blog, or allowing your friends to see your
pictures while others cannot. In other words, finding `what` you may do.

TurboGears 2 applications may take advantage of a robust, extendable, pluggable
and easy-to-use system for authentication and authorization suitable for nearly
all situations â€” in fact, you may extend it to suite your needs if it doesn't,
which should be really simple in most situations. Such a system is made up of
two independent components, well integrated into TurboGears:

  * :mod:`repoze.who`, a framework for ``authentication`` in WSGI applications.
    You normally don't have to care about it because by default TG2
    applications ship all the code to set it up (as long as you had selected
    such an option when you created the project), but if you need something
    more advanced you are at the right place.
  * :mod:`repoze.what`, the successor of :mod:`tg.ext.repoze.who` and
    :mod:`tgext.authorization` (used in unstable TG2 releases), is a framework 
    for ``authorization`` that is mostly compatible with the TurboGears 1.x 
    `Identity` authentication, identification and authorization system.

You may store your users' credentials where you want (e.g., in a database, an
LDAP server, an Htaccess file) and also store your authorization settings
in any type of source (e.g., in a database, Ini file) -- if the back-end you
need is not available, you may create it yourself (which is usually very easy).
And don't worry if you need to change the back-end afterwards: You would not
need to touch your code! Except, of course, the snippet that tells where the
data may be found.


The three pillars: Users, groups and permissions
------------------------------------------------

:mod:`repoze.what` uses a common pattern based on the ``users`` (authenticated 
or anonymous) of your web application, the ``groups`` they belong to and the 
``permissions`` granted to such groups. But you can extend it to check for many
other conditions (such as checking that the user comes from a given country, 
based on her IP address, for example).

The authentication framework (:mod:`repoze.who`) only deals with the
source(s) that handle your users' credentials, while the
authorization framework (:mod:`repoze.what`) deals with both the
source(s) that handle your groups and those that handle your permissions.


Getting started, quickly
------------------------

While :mod:`repoze.what` only deals with authorization, its SQL plugin 
provides a module to setup authentication via :mod:`repoze.who` so that you can 
get started with authentication and authorization very quickly. It may be 
enabled while creating the TG2 project or afterwards, and it may be easily 
replaced by a custom solution.

To use it on a new projet, just answer "yes" during the `paster quickstart`
process when it asks you if you want auth::

  Do you need authentication and authorization in this project? [yes]

You'll then get authentication and authorization code added for you, including
the SQLAlchemy-powered model definitions in ``{yourpackage}.model.auth`` 
and the relevant settings in ``{yourpackage}.config.app_cfg``. It also defines 
the default users, groups and permissions in ``{yourpackage}.websetup``, which 
you may want to customize.

Before trying to login and try authorization with the rows defined in
``{yourpackage}.websetup``, you have to create the database; run the following
command from your project's root directory::

    paster setup-app development.ini

.. note::
  This module is :mod:`repoze.what.plugins.quickstart` and only works if your
  users' credentials, groups and permissions are stored in a `SQLAlchemy
  <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_ -managed 
  database. To implement it on an existing project, or customize the model 
  structure assumed by it, you have to read the documentation for 
  :mod:`repoze.what.plugins.quickstart`.


Beyond the quickstart
---------------------

If you need more power than that provided by the quickstart, or if you just
want to customize some things, you may want to read the following pages:
