Data Aggregation
================

Moksha provides many ways to acquire data in an efficient manner.

Moksha can communicate with various message brokers, using the `AMQP
<http://amqp.org>`_, `STOMP <http://stomp.codehaus.org/Protocol>`_,
and/or `0mq <http://www.zeromq.org/>`_
protocols.  It also provides a simple API for producing and consuming messages,
as well as allowing widgets to subscribe to live message streams within the
users web browser.  It provides an **abstraction** over the different messaging
technologies.
