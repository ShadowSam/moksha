Introduction to Moksha
======================

What is Moksha?
---------------

A Platform
~~~~~~~~~~
A highly scalable platform for creating, running, and wielding dashboards of
live collaborative widgets that extract and extend data from arbitrary
resources in an intelligent and efficient manner.

A Framework
~~~~~~~~~~~
Compiled from the best-of-breed components, Moksha applications are written
using stable pre-existing modules that allow for the rapid creation of powerful
applications.  It is designed to allow non-developers to easily develop
applications in isolation, without worrying about the under/over-lying software
stack.

A Language
~~~~~~~~~~
A language for creating powerful reusable widgets that communicate with a
variety of external resources and can be displayed and collaborated upon in
real-time, turning every page into a live social dashboard.

A Hub
~~~~~
Moksha also acts as a live notification hub that allows people and other
applications and services to create, publish, and subscribe to arbitrary
message streams.

A Community
~~~~~~~~~~~
Gives people the ability to create adhoc groups based around any
project/idea/initiative/location.  It facilitates live interactive discourse,
by default, and ensures that every voice is heard.

A Mentor
~~~~~~~~~
Moksha will also facilitate collaboration around various tasks, projects,
ideas, etc, could maintain state for various workflow processes.  Since it will
be aware of all of it's sub-communities, it could potentially delegate tasks to
teams or users based on the skills required to complete the task, while providing guidance along the way to help achieve goals.
