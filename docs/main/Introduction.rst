Introduction to Moksha
======================

What is Moksha?
---------------

A Platform
~~~~~~~~~~
A highly scalable architecture for creating, running, and wielding dashboards of
live collaborative widgets that extract and extend data from arbitrary
resources in an intelligent and efficient manner.

A Framework
~~~~~~~~~~~
Compiled from the best-of-breed components, Moksha applications are written
using stable pre-existing modules that allow for the creation of extremely
powerful applications.  Allows non-developers to easily develop applications in
isolation, without worrying about the under/over-lying software stack.

A Language
~~~~~~~~~~
A language for creating powerful reusable widgets that communicate with a
variety of external resources and can be displayed and collaborated upon in
real-time, turning every page into a live dashboard.

A Hub
~~~~~
Moksha also acts as a live notification hub that allows people and other
applications to create, publish, and subscribe to arbitrary message streams.

A Community
~~~~~~~~~~~
Gives people the ability to create adhoc groups based around any
project/idea/initiative/location.  Facilitates live interactive discourse,
by default.  Ensures that every voice is heard.

A Mentor
~~~~~~~~~
Facilitates collaboration around various tasks, projects, ideas, etc.
Maintains state for various workflow processes.  Delegates tasks to teams/users
based on skills required to complete the task.  Provides guidance to achieve goals.
