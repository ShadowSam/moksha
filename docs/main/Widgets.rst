Widgets
=======

A ``Widget`` in Moksha is simply a `ToscaWidget <http://toscawidgets.org>`_.
ToscaWidgets is a framework for building reusable web components, and is fully
integrated into TurboGears2, and thus Moksha, out of the box.  Along with their
official documentation, you can also find great ToscaWidgets tutorials in the
`TurboGears2 http://www.turbogears.org/2.0/docs/toc.html>`_ docs.

Moksha also provides a number of Widgets in its API, some of which include:
